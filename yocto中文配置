We are able to recompile a busybox with yocto sumo (L4.14.98_2.0.0). Can you please try to recompile the busybox with a newer version?

Our configurations are:

Yocto sumo (L4.14.98_2.0.0)
Host system: ubuntu 16.04
Distro : fsl-imx-xwayland
Image: fsl-image-qt5-validation-imx
The steps which we have followed are as per below:

$ source setup-environment <build-directory>
$ bitbake fsl-image-qt5-validation-imx
Made changes in printable_string.c & unicode.c file from this link: 
   https://programmer.help/blogs/linux-busybox-chinese-display-modification-instructions.html 
To add support of Chinese characters you can refer the below link:

   https://community.nxp.com/t5/i-MX-Processors/Building-Qt5-Yocto-Image-with-Turkish-and-Chinese-characters/m-p/666336 

$ vi conf/local.conf      (add the following two lines at the end to support Chinese)

    GLIBC_GENERATE_LOCALES = "zh_CN.UTF-8 en_GB.UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8"

    IMAGE_LINGUAS ?= "zh-cn"

$ bitbake -c compile busybox -f  (recompile the busybox)

$ bitbake fsl-image-qt5-validation-imx -f (recompile your image with changes)
copy the .ttf of your fonts to the  /usr/share/fonts/ttf/  in rootfs of your image.
Boot up the board with the image.
# vi /etc/profile      (add the following line at the end)

    export LANG=zh_CN.UTF-8

Open any text file containing Chinese font to verify.
Let us know in case of any concerns.
